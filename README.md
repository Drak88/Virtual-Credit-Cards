# Virtual Credits Cards

Create Virtuals Credits Cards completely FREE.

# Requirements

Python

Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you use Windows 7 you should install the version "3.6.0"

# Setup

Open the file "vcc_server.py". If a window named "Open with" (or something) appears then search the program "pythonw.exe" in the Python folder.

Then open the another file named "vi_cr_ca.pyw".

# How to use

The program "vcc_server.pyw" is the server. The accounts are saved and showed in this program.

For starting you should make a account (for testing the program). For do that then click the option "Cuentas" in the principal menu.

Add a starting money amount. Then add a "Cedula" (it means "Identification card", it's only a number that identifies a account). And finally add a password.

In the program "vi_cr_ca.pyw" add a money amount that you'll subtract to the account. Put the "Cedula" (I already explained what it is). And put the password.

And then you have seen the magic of this program :)
